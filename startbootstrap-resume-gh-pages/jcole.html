<div class="headline">J Cole's Life Story</div>
<div class="para1">Jermaine Lamarr Cole was born in Frankfurt, Germany, to an interracial couple serving in the U.S. Army. Cole's black father would later abandon the family, prompting his mother to relocate Jermaine and his brother, Zach, to Fayetteville, North Carolina.</div>
<div class="para1">Cole began rapping at 12, and was encouraged to see it as a future career when his mother purchased an ASR-X musical sampler as a Christmas gift three years later.</div>
<div class="para1">Upon graduating high school Cole decided that his chances of securing a record contract would be heightened in New York City. He moved to the Big Apple, where he attended St. John's University on an academic scholarship. Cole majored in communications and business, later graduating magna cum laude in 2007, with a 3.8 GPA.</div>
<div class="para1">On the first verse of the 2014 Forest Hills Drive track "Apparently," Cole apologises to his mom for leaving her to deal with foreclosure at his Fayetville childhood home, while he was away chasing girls and partying at St. John's University. Eventually, in June 2014 Cole purchased the house back and renovated it to look exactly how it did when he lived there.</div>
<div class="para1">After graduating, Cole worked various part-time jobs, including a $8-an-hour working ad salesman for a newspaper, while hoping to jump start his rap career. On one occasion, he camped outside of the Roc the Mic studios in Manhattan, where Jay-Z was recording American Gangster. The young would-be rapper wished to hand his idol a demo CD, but Hova refused to accept it. "We were standing in the rain for hours, drinking a bottle of E&J for courage," he recalled to Billboard magazine. "Finally a [Rolls-Royce] Phantom rolled up, and sure enough, Jay got out. But he was real short with me: 'I don't want that.' I was crushed, like, 'Did that really just happen? F--k him.'"</div>
<div class="para1">Things turned around when Cole became the first artist signed to Jay-Z's Roc Nation's label wing in early 2009. It was the North Carolina rapper's The Warm Up mixtape track "Lights Please," which scored him his Roc Nation deal, after Jay-Z heard a pre-release version of the song.</div>
<div class="para2">Seconds after Cole heard via text message that he'd been signed to Roc Nation, the ecstatic rapper was bought back to earth when his car was pulled over by a cop and he was arrested.Cole made his commercial debut in 2009 with a guest verse on Jay-Z's aptly titled track "A Star is Born.
    J. Cole made history on the Hot 100 dated May 5, 2018 when he became the first act ever to debut three songs simultaneously in the top 10 of the tally. "ATM" arrived at #6, "Kevin's Heart" at #8 and "KOD" at #10</div>
